 *
 * URI regular expression in PCRE2
 * reference: RFC 3986 Appendix A (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#appendix-A)
 *
 * NOTE:
 *   * URI is repleced by SCHEMELESS_URI, because the entire URI regex is dynamically constructed
 *     using an user-configured list of target schemes. SCHEME is used to validate the list.
 *   * Also, the following definitions are omitted:
 *     - URI-reference      only used in relative URIs.
 *     - relative-ref       (as above)
 *     - relative-part      (as above)
 *     - path-noscheme      (as above)
 *     - segment-nz-nc      (as above)
 *     - absolute-URI       special case of URI. not distinguishable in regex.
 *     - path               not referenced from any other rules.
 *     - path-empty         to avoid highlighting meaningless URI like `foo:`.
